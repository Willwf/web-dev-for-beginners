Projects created while studying on the Web Development for Beginners repository.

[Web Development for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners)

## Each lesson includes:

- optional sketchnote
- optional supplemental video
- pre-lesson warmup quiz
- written lesson
- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- knowledge checks
- a challenge
- supplemental reading
- assignment
- post-lesson quiz

> All of the projects includes a readme file with descriptions about it. Most of them have changes from the original to study and learn the concepts and to complete the challenges. I kept the original credits of the authors.
