# My Terrarium: A project to learn about HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation using JavaScript üåµüå±

A small drag and drop code-meditation. With a little HTML, JS and CSS, you can build a web interface, style it, and add an interaction.

You can click and drag a plant to whatever place you like and organize to build your terrarium. Double-clicking a plant that is behind another one can bring it to the front.

The artwork was hand drawn by [Jen Looper](http://jenlooper.com) using Procreate.

The challenges of the lessons were concluded by [William Firmino](https://https://github.com/Willwf).
